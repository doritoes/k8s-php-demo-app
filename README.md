# k8s-php-demo-app
LEMP stack demo app designed for k8s demonstration

This is a basic PHP demonstration app inspired by [https://github.com/Sayandeep/Webapp] (Syandeep's version) for us in the Lab exercise at [https://www.unclenuc.com/lab:kubernetes_app:start]. A separate k8s pod is provides sql-service while mulitple pods front the application.
